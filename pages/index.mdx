## Hi,

I'm Alypher, a modest Software Engineer since 2019, Nowadays working for Intelie by Viasat, so my developments are prived, but I have some personal projects too.
Before Intelie, I worked with cyber security, this is my hobby now, so, I'm available for some projects!

If you have a chance, take a look on my projects. Feel free to be in touch!
