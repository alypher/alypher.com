## Hi,

I'm Alypher, a modest Software Engineer since 2019. Nowadays working for Intelie by Viasat, helping product & delivery teams to deliver the customer's dream.
Most of my projects are private, because I am dedicating more time to help some friends in their ideas and my main focus now is to a Intelie project (to an Oil&Gas company), but I have some personal projects too, sometimes I have time to try a new framework, new cool things.
Before Intelie, I worked with cyber security, this is my hobby now, so, I'm available to take a break and get a coffee and talk about your project!

If you have a chance, take a look on my projects. Feel free to be in touch!
